The Python scripts *btcreate.py* and *btsearch.py* have been replaced by a [Python3 package](http://github.com/rtrollebo/bibmanagerpy).

In order to access a publication database, the `bibmanagerpy` package contains features to communicate with the official NASA ADS API. The packages also contains some basic features for bibliography management. It aims to be compliant to the *BiBTeX* publication types, and contains routines to convert to and from *BiBTeX*.
