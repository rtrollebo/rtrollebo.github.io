In the field of solar physics, the energy budget of the solar
atmosphere has not yet been fully understood. The coronal temperature
is maintained in the mega-kelvin range  ∼ 1.5 * 10^6 K, which is about
3 orders of magnitude above the photospheric temperature (4 * 10 ^ 3
K). These properties of the solar corona have been known from spectral
observations for more than 60 years. However, the mystery on how the
solar corona receives its energy has been largely unlocked. Two
theories have evolved as to how the corona is heated:

* Mechanical wave energy transfer

	MHD-waves transfer mechanical energy (initiated by granular plasma
    motions, possibly sub-photospheric) to the solar corona where
    energy is converted to heat.

* Nanoflares

	A multitude of seemingly spontaneous heating events in the corona,
    occurring on very short time scales and small (sub-resolution)
    spacial scales -- heats the corona. These events are likely caused
    by magnetic re-connection (and their source may be the same as for
    MHD-waves; build up of magnetic stress due to granular plasma
    motions).

The physical processes responsible for the heating of the corona take
place in small spatial and temporal ranges. Until very recently, the
instruments (e.g. SUMER, EIS) did not have the resolving capability to
observe the highly dynamic features of the solar atmosphere. For
example, many small-scale changes in the magnetic field (such as
re-connection) occur too fast to be detectable by former instrumental
configurations. However, since the Interface Region Imaging
Spectrograph [1] became operational in late
2013, its spectrograph has delivered data with higher spatial and
temporal resolution than ever before.

Type II spicule is likely to play a role in providing hot plasma to
the corona. While this solar feature has long been considered only a
minor component in the total heating budget [2], observational evidence from IRIS
coupled with simulations have caused a revival of the theory of
spicule-associated heating [3].
