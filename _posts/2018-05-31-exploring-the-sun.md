# Studying the sun

Using a large number of independent instrumental approaches decreases the influence of instrumental bias thus increasing the value of a hypothesis test. 

In the case of the sun, most of our observational data has been obtained from satellite-based instruments, such as SUMER and EIS, and later the IRIS missions. By studying the light from particular spectral lines, we have been able to observe the atmosphere in particular temperature regimes of interest.

Furthermore, from properties of light, we have also been able to measure the magnetic fields in the photosphere by using techniques such as Stokes polarimetry. And with upcoming missions, additional instruments will be used to obtain a more complete understanding of the physics of the sun.

### Mission Description

For the first time, a solar probe will be launched in august 2018. And once it reaches its target in 2024, it will be the first ever probe to fly through the outer solar corona (at a distance of 8 solar radii), providing in-situ measurements of particle energies and plasma properties. The probe is named Parker Solar Probe (Fox et al. (2015)), and its scientific mission is to

1. Trace the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the solar corona and solar wind;

2. Determine the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind; and

3. Explore mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles. 

Objective 1) -- [Heating of the Solar Corona]({% post_url 2018-03-18-heating-of-solar-corona %}) --  is one of the most important scientific questions about the sun. Objective 3) is related to our aim at understanding precursors and causes to energetic events, generating high energy particles towards Earth that strongly impacts Earths magnetosphere. Ultimately, this objective could make us more capable of improving space weather predictions.

To fulfill its objective, the Parker Solar Probe is supported by a set of measurement requirements and science investigations, of which the most important are:

* Measurements of the magnetic and electric field (supported by the FIELDS science investigations: Two fluxgate magnetometers, a search coil magnetometer and five electric antennas will measure electric and magnetic fields and waves);

* Intensity, spectrum and pitch-angle distribution of electrons, protons and heavy ions. The SWEAP science investigations provide two electrostatic analyzers and a Faraday cup. These instruments enable counting particles (electrons, protons and helium ions) in the solar wind, and provide measurement of velocity, density and temperature. The ISIS energetic particle instrument suite will make observations of energetic electrons, protons and heavy ions that are accelerated to high energies; 
* Imaging of solar structures in order to provide context to magnetic events in the solar atmosphere. The WISPR white light telescope will provide imaging data of the solar corona, revealing properties and behavior of solar wind and other plasma structures and magnetohydrodynamic shocks.
