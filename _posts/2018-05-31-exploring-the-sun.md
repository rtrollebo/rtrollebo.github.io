# Studying the sun

In the case of the sun, most of our observational data has been obtained from satellite-based instruments, such as SUMER and EIS, and later the IRIS missions. By studying the light from particular spectral lines, we have been able to observe the atmosphere in particular temperature regimes of interest. Using a large number of instrumental approaches has made us more capable of answering important theoretical questions, such as the [coronal heating problem](http://rtrollebo.github.io/notes/2018/03/18/heating-of-solar-corona/). 


From properties of light, we have also been able to measure the magnetic fields on the "surface" of the sun (the photosphere) by using techniques such as Stokes polarimetry. 


# Upcoming Solar Missions

For the first time, a solar probe will be launched in 2018. And once it reaches its target in 2024, it will be the first ever probe to fly through the outer solar corona (at a distance of 8 solar radii), providing in-situ measurements of particle energies and plasma properties. The probe is named Parker Solar Probe, and its scientific mission is to further examine the conditions of the corona in which solar wind acceleration takes place.
